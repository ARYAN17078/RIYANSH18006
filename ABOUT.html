        <h1>LKSEC, GOTAN.</h1>
        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
          The LK Singhania Education Centre at Gotan came into existence as a full-fledged, premier residential school in July 1987 as a realization of the values and dreams of the great visionary, Late Lala Kamlapat Singhania. The school is Senior Secondary, co-educational English medium affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi. Accommodating 1650 students including 950 boarders from all parts of the country and internationally as well, the LK Singhania Education Centre is a unique mix of the traditional and modern. This centre is a multicultural, co-educational boarding school where traditions, religions and beliefs from all walks of life are respected and celebrated. The aim is to nurture each child individually to help them become global citizens.

          Although the school was initiated in 1984 with the aim to provide education to the children of JK White Cement employees only, with the great social commitment of the JK organization, it meant that the school should be expanded to provide quality education to the children of one and all with the non-profit motive. Since then, the school has grown from strength to strength in every sphere of education as well as in sports and extracurricular activities to provide an integrated learning environment for all its students. The prominent transformational phase in its history came in 1987 when the centre started providing boarding facilities to students from all over India and abroad. The school is fully equipped with ultramodern educational facilities to ensure that all the needs of students for a truly holistic development are met with. All types of co-curricular activities, sports and games are highly encouraged for a perfect all-round development of students.
          
          At the LK Singhania Education Centre, we are confident that our children see themselves as great thinkers, successful learners and future leaders. Being a premier co-educational boarding school, we also inculcate values in our students to sustain and enhance rich cultural heritage and also prepare young learners to keep pace with challenges to come.        </p>

           <h3>FROM THE PRESIDENT'S DESK </h3>
            <p>
              Dear Parents,

              On behalf of the Management, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for your patience, cooperation and understanding during this difficult time. Our mission is to provide the best education to the children of our school, in a safe learning environment, that encourages excellence. LKS has been committed to the above objective since its inception. Our endeavour is to help all our students become outstanding individuals and responsible citizens. The School's enthusiastic and devoted team of administrators and faculty members have always focused on collaborating to ensure better learning for the students.
              
              These are trying times. However, we will strive to do our best to follow all precautions to ensure everyone's safety and well-being. Abiding by the orders of the Government, we had to close the school early to curb the spread of COVID 19, but we are sure that we will soon emerge stronger out of this crisis, together.
              
              We request you all to be patient and look forward to your support in our efforts towards building a caring, secure and safe haven for our children.
              
              I wish all the stakeholders good health and express my deepest appreciation for taking ahead our shared vision.
              
              Raghavpat Singhania
              President
            </p>
