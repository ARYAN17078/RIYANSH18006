            <h3>Principal’s Message</h3>
            <h4>FROM THE PRINCIPAL’S DESK</h4>
            <p>
              welcome you all to this session of 2023! Our commitments have always been and will always be to provide a safe and intellectually challenging environment where the students feel empowered academically, creatively and rationally so they may thrive in the twenty-first century.
              I believe that in this unforgettable journey of learning and growth, we work together successfully to help them aim higher and strive for more. Our approach has always been an integrated one to provide an experience in various subjects. Learning by doing is the main objective more because the future seems to be all set to expand on trend of artificial intelligence. So, all our traditional approach of teaching and learning should explore the possibilities within the frame of machine intelligence instead of being guided by cocooned form of teaching-learning. Their inspiration and aspiration nowadays should be defined as trendspire for the unexplored realm of education. It is with pride that we hold these thoughts and standards and help them commit to maintaining the extraordinary record of achievements as a legacy of our school. Challenges, confidence, multitasking, and valuing time are some of the important aspects of experiential learning that we try to provide them keeping in mind the fact that it is important to give space for redressing of any unpredictability of randomness.
              Our vision is to encourage the growth of existence that has a sense of belongingness; a spirit of “go ahead and try it”; the ability to convey an entire gamut of expressions, posing questions, examining possibilities; and applying skills to find solutions to issues. Besides encouraging exposure and extending varied opportunities to students in their sphere of interest, we make sure of their contribution to the nation as well as help them remain grounded in a collaborative and respectful manner.
              I believe in tapping students’ resourcefulness to bring out their promising talent to the fore. So, my capacity brings to the focus the need for growth of students and staff; need for expression; and the need to make an informed choice and that’s what I am doing, while being aligned with the set targets and aims laid in the vision of the school. Together, we can make it possible. If I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me. I can be reached at principallks@gmail.com. I feel honoured to serve you.
              Sincerely
              Mr.R.C.Joshi

              <h4>IPSC Hockey <bR>(U-15) </h4>
              <p style="font-size: very xx-small;">
                The rigorous training formed the seed out of which the guts to defeat all through, barring the final match, was born. And with it began a journey of knowing and realizing one's potential which stays today and even tomorrow will live on. This thought popped up at the interesting demonstration of IPSC Hockey Tournament (U-15) that was held between September 6th to September 8th in the Hockey ground of the school.
